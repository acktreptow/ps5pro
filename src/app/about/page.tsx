          Why This Website Exists
        </h2>
        <p>
          A dedicated website that details all the PlayStation 5 Pro (PS5 Pro)
          upgrades for each game would be an invaluable resource for both gamers
          and industry professionals. As gaming technology continues to evolve,
          players are increasingly looking for ways to optimize their
          experience, and the launch of the PS5 Pro, with its enhanced hardware,
          presents a significant opportunity to do just that. Here is why.
