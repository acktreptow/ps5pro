It will be interesting to see whether Pro's performance mode uses a less resource-intensive upscaler than PSSR to ensure a stable 60+fps. This would be particularly noteworthy as the September State of Play demo (running on base PS5 quality mode with no RT at 1440p) couldn't even sustain 30fps, and dipped as low as 18fps. Fortunately in late December, there was a delay from March to May 2026. This suggests IOI will take the necessary time to ensure proper optimization."

All versions are also poorly aliased (even PC), so resolution differences are less noticeable compared to other games because there's so much shimmer/jaggies regardless. There's also low resolution surfaces and very poor SSR (equivalent to PC low settings) that exacerbate the shimmer. Finally, the overkill AO (including the RT) overly silhouettes the image (especially characters) on all consoles and can't be turned off."

Splitscreen multiplayer is now a locked 60fps (mid 50s on base PS5). Base PS5 120 Hz mode is less stable than Pro's and also runs at a lower, more 1008p-1080p resolution. Base PS5 fidelity mode has a similar resolution, but still looks less stable due to Pro's good PSSR implementation.'"

RTGI quality is the same on both, but Pro has a slightly better draw distance and anisotropic filtering. Variable rate shading is used on every console (Xbox too), resulting in a blurrier image than the resolution would suggest. VRS is therefore least noticeable on Pro.

However, it doesn't even have DL2's balanced mode or any of its 3 RT features. Hopefully, these come in a patch - resolution bumps are nice, but it's a far cry from what Techland promised.

To presumably get the Pro enhanced badge then (as both consoles have the same description), Pro will utilize a higher DRS before upscaling to 4K - resulting in a sharper image than on base PS5 in the same scene. Pro's extra horsepower should also result in a more stable 30fps. Although as a remake of a PS2 game, there really should be a 60fps mode.

Base PS5 is also only capable of RTGI at up to 60fps with VRR unlocked. RTGI can significantly enhance image quality (especially scenes with lots of sunlight) with more realistic lighting and shadows that adds nuance/depth. Despite the 1080p-1656p internal resolution in RT Pro mode, its excellent PSSR implementation results in an image as sharp as quality mode's native 4K. PSSR also trades blows in image quality - some assets are a little noisier, but others are more stable/have less ghosting with PSSR. With VRR, Pro averages slightly higher framerates than the equivalent mode on base PS5 (71fps vs 64fps avg in performance mode etc).

All info is from DF's analysis of real-time base PS5 gameplay, making it a good baseline of what to expect on Pro. GTA 6's resolution was 1440p. There's diffuse RTGI for direct/indirect lighting and it's more stable compared to software UE5 Lumen that's popular on consoles. There's RT reflections that includes dynamic objects like people, even on rough/opaque surfaces (water etc), but SSR is still sometimes used in combination. RT reflections on transparent surfaces (glass) is top-tier. There's no RT shadows, but still looks great with accurate diffuse. The trailer's most impressive aspect is the accurate/natural hair rendering, regardless of hairstyle and even body hair. Finally, even on Pro, a 60fps mode is unlikely, but 40fps could be possible - especially with the delay to November 2026 which gives the Rockstar time to implement FSR4 and/or PSSR2."

For example, particularly bad pop in could be caused by the game itself or the Cloud's current bandwidth. The same flight on the same PS5 can therefore render different image quality, although Pro generally has less pop in and increased draw distances. Both consoles also default to a 30fps cap, but can be unlocked with VRR. However, even with the PC-like menu of 10+ graphical settings (character quality, fauna density etc) set to their lowest, the framerate rarely reaches 60fps, can even dip to 25fps-27fps when flying low in cities, and is generally between 30-40fps (with Pro averaging 3-4fps higher). Finally, there's no RT shadows seen in PC's cockpit mode, which DF speculated could be a Pro-exclusive enhancement."

Hopefully, this also changes with improved optimization before the February 6, 2026 release."

The 120 Hz mode has no SSR, missing rain effects, and a far worse draw distance/LODs where many assets like trash bags/rocks don't render at all.

This falls in line with the Gamescom demo DF conducted on a high-end PC, which didn't use UE5's Lumen reflections/GI (or Virtual Shadow Maps). Instead, it used traditional RT reflections (only in bodies of water like puddles) and shadows, as well as baked (non-RT) GI. This targeted RT approach should allow Pro to include multiple RT implementations (to a higher quality base PS5 can't reach) with a stable, non-frame generated 60fps.

The reason it's taking time is because QE was developed on an old version of UE5 that didn't support Pro because it didn't even exist. As a small studio, the engine update/upgrade is a huge task - much bigger than having it already incorporated during the development of their new game, Code Violet.

The Series X fares even worse, with downgraded  graphical settings/resolution compared to base PS5. Fortunately, VOID have acknowledged these issues and said this will be fixed in a future patch, which hopefully also comes with proper Pro enhancements. At the very least right now, Pro helps Ready or Not maintain its 60fps more often, though it can still dip into the mid 50s. Due to the unevenly paced 30fps, quality mode isn't recommended as it results in a sub-optimal experience on both PS5 consoles."

As according to DF, Saros's debut base PS5 gameplay looked like a highly customized version of UE5 (no Lumen, Nanite or VSMs). Therefore, Saros shouldn't struggle as much as other UE5 games. Especially as base PS5 ran Saros at 1080p/60fps - 'The Pro has roughly 2.5x the resolution compared to base PS5, resulting in a very frequent internal resolution of 1728p max (infrequent DRS of 1350p min) that outputs to 4K (base PS5 is a fixed 1080p that reconstructs to 1440p before upscaling to a 4K checkerboard). This leads to a less noisy/grainy image with less aliasing/flickering, though some image instability remains. Both PS5 consoles have framerate dips into the low 50s, but this occurs less often on Pro, and even the largest dips are still in the VRR window. Technically, Returnal uses other forms of RT outside of audio. However, this is only for background calculations.'"

However, Pro's quality mode, despite a more 4K like image and better RT, has so much PSSR shimmer that base PS5 quality mode looks better with TSR. Bloober has confirmed that they're working with Konami on a patch which will hopefully improve the PSSR implementation or revert to TSR (as they did for performance).

However, Pro's poor PSSR implementation suffers from artifacting/strobing on assets like grass (seen in games at Pro's launch due to early versions of PSSR). Base PS5 uses UE5's TSR to upscale, resulting in quality mode looking superior, although Pro is sharper than its performance mode. Assets affected by PSSR are also mainly in the first area, so it isn't as distracting later on.

At best, Pro has a negligible increase in resolution that you'd find hard to notice even when looking at both versions side by side. Non-Pro enhanced games like Metaphor: ReFantazio showcase more significant improvements simply due to Pro's increased horsepower.'"

RT doesn't significantly impact either resolution or framerate, which is a 50-60fps on both consoles at the beginning of the game, but gets progressively worse (dips to 30s) in later, more built up/populated regions (especially on base PS5). Pro's 1440p internal resolution and great PSSR 4K upscale implementation results in a 4K-like image. Foliage (which can be all over the screen) is especially sharp and looks far more dithered on base PS5's 1080p to 4K upscale, although Pro also still suffers from pop in."

Spider-Man was also held back by an open-world originally designed around the PS4. The September 2025 State of Play demo was (likely) running at the 30fps quality mode, which had an internal resolution of 1440p in gameplay and 15120p-1600p in cutscenes, with RT reflections, but not RT shadows. DF themselves say there's a lot of continuity from Spider-Man 2, but already noticeable upgrades in aspects like facial models. We'll hopefully get even more information at the promised info update in spring 2026."

FPS mode can fall out of the VRR range on base PS5 and hitch with sudden resolutions changes/autosaves, whereas Pro aims for as high as 80fps on 120 HZ TVs, with no hitches. 540p can result in extreme artifacting regardless of console. Finally, base PS5 aims for 30/40fps in its graphics/balanced modes, and both are unevenly paced. This make FPS mode the only viable option on base PS5 for smooth gameplay, whereas all 3 modes are viable on Pro."
