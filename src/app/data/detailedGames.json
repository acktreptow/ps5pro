Instead of listing 50+ modes, the 2 above represent what the general PoE2 community recommend depending on your framerate target. Performance mode can dip in heavy fights, but should stay above 60fps most of the time. NIS is sharper and more performant that PSSR, but less stable in motion and can look too sharp. Though PSSR's softness results in a loss of texture detail. If you want to maximize frames, ensure lighting is set to just 'shadows' instead of  'shadows + GI'. Dynamic culling is also not recommended as it can cause severe graphical issues."
