There's diffuse RTGI for direct/indirect lighting and it's more stable compared to software UE5 Lumen that's popular on consoles. There's RT reflections that includes dynamic objects like people, even on rough/opaque surfaces (water etc), but SSR is still sometimes used in combination. RT reflections on transparent surfaces (glass) is top-tier. There's no RT shadows, but still looks great with accurate diffuse. The trailer's most impressive aspect is the accurate/natural hair rendering, regardless of hairstyle and even body hair. Finally, even on Pro, a 60fps mode is unlikely, but 40fps could be possible."

It's already been confirmed that H2 will now include a 60fps mode that has a lower resolution and worse graphical settings, but won't strip out features like RT. This mode will be on Series X/base PS5, meaning it's also there on Pro. But while Pro could probably render at native 4K, it'll likely keep Series X's 1440p for its 60fps mode due to H2's extensive use of post-processing, which minimizes the impact of a base resolution increase. Hopefully instead, Pro incorporates superior hardware-accelerated RT that would be exclusive to Pro/PC, but this is just optimistic speculation. Ninja Theory have also confirmed that Pro can use either PSSR or UE5's TSR as the upscaler, so it will be interesting to see which performs better especially as PSSR isn't possible on base PS5."

Additionally, Nioh 3 was unable to maintain a stable 60fps or a consistent 1080p+ resolution in either its prioritize framerate or prioritize graphics modes on both consoles, though the Pro performed better on average. That said, this was just a demo, so these issues will likely improve by Nioh 3's launch. Unfortunately, given Nioh 3's current-gen only, and now open-world design, hitting 120fps may not be feasible without unacceptable resolution tradeoffs.

Performance mode can dip in heavy fights, but should stay above 60fps most of the time. NIS is sharper and more performant that PSSR, but less stable in motion and can look too sharp.

S-Game have also stated that AMD have provided hardware-base RT solutions for PS5, so perhaps a Pro quality mode will support RT in a way that base PS5 can't.
